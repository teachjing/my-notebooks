# Samples

This is a collection of sample notebooks (usually with output and widget state preserved) that give you more of a sense of what the notebook will do.

This folder also contains example notebooks that demonstrate technique using specific
cases as examples. As such they would not produce meaningful results in other 
environments. You can use these notebooks as examples and are free to copy and paste sections
into your own notebooks.

## WARNING
These notebooks are meant to be illustrative of specific scenarios and are not actively maintained.
They are unlikely to be runnable directly in your environment. Instead, please use the notebooks
in the root of this repo.

## Viewing the notebooks
You can view any of the notebooks directly on github just by clicking on them.

For higher fidelity rendering we'd recommend Jupyter nbviewer.
- Open a notebook here and copy the URL
- Go to <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">Jupyter nbview</a> and paste the URL into the location text box.
- Hit the Go! button
